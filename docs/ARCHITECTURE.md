## System Overview

### Overview
Cloi is a Node.js-based Command Line Interface (CLI) tool powered by Python Machine Learning (ML) services. It employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for sophisticated error analysis and auto-fix capabilities in terminal environments. Leveraging both local (via Ollama) and cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Claude, Cloi processes terminal errors and applies intelligent code fixes using CodeBERT embeddings.

### Features
- **Error Analysis**: Parses and analyzes terminal errors.
- **Automatic Code Fixes**: Suggests and applies fixes to code leveraging CodeBERT.
- **LLM Support**: Local (Ollama) and cloud-based (Claude) integrations.
- **Extensibility**: Modular plugin design.
- **Integration Flexibility**: Adaptable for various CI/CD systems and browser testing infrastructure.

### Key Dependencies
- Node.js
- Python ML services
- Libraries: `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `@huggingface/transformers`, `faiss-node`, and others (see full dependency list in the [Introduction](#key-information)).

## Component Architecture

### High-Level Design
Cloi adopts a modular architecture, where components are divided into **core modules** and **plugin-based extensions**. Core modules handle core functionalities like error parsing, AI integration, and RAG operations, while plugins provide extensibility for custom integrations.

### Primary Component Modules
1. **Protocols**: Defines communication pathways (e.g., HTTP/embedded protocols).
   - Example: `src/protocols/a2a/`
2. **Plugins**: Extend functionality in specific domains.
   - **Quality Analysis**: `src/plugins/quality/`
   - **Integrations**: `src/plugins/integrations/`
   - **External Provider Plugins**: Handles LLM providers like Ollama and Claude.
3. **Analyzers**: Perform specialized tasks like repository analysis or environment checks.
   - Example: `src/plugins/analyzers/`
4. **Core RAG Operations**: Indexing, embedding, and retrieval handled by modules like CodeBERT and FAISS.

### Module Interaction
- **Protocols** handle communication between the CLI and Python-based ML services.
- **Core Modules** act as orchestration layers, invoking plugins or analyzers as needed.
- **Plugins** provide domain-specific logic that can override or enhance core behavior.

## Data Flow

### Overview
Cloi employs a predictable flow of data through its components using a pipeline-style architecture.

### Data Pipeline
1. **Input**:
   - Input is captured through CLI commands or terminal logs.
2. **Pre-Processing**:
   - Errors are parsed and validated by the protocol (AJV, YAML parsing, etc.).
   - Relevant data is extracted and normalized.
3. **Indexing and Retrieval**:
   - Data is passed to the RAG layer utilizing CodeBERT embeddings to retrieve contextual insights.
   - FAISS is employed for efficient vector search.
4. **AI Processing**:
   - Local LLMs (Ollama) or Cloud LLMs (Claude) process queries and provide responses tailored to the issue.
5. **Post-Processing**:
   - Responses are formatted and validated.
   - If applicable, proposed fixes are applied or output is delivered to the user.
6. **Output**:
   - Results are either displayed in the CLI or written as updates to the local codebase.

## Integration Points

Cloi integrates with various external services to extend functionality.

### Local LLM Integration: Ollama
- **Protocol**: Local inference via HTTP or CLI binding.
- **Usage**: Provides fast, on-device inference for privacy-critical applications or environments without cloud connectivity.

### Cloud LLM Integration: Claude (Anthropic)
- **Protocol**: Cloud-based API using `@anthropic-ai/sdk`.
- **Usage**: Enables more robust and complex language modeling with Claude capabilities.

### ML Models and Infrastructure
- **CodeBERT Embeddings**: Employed for generating semantic embeddings used in the RAG loop. Library: `@huggingface/transformers`.
- **FAISS Index**: Indexes and efficiently retrieves embeddings locally.

## Security Architecture

### Security Objectives
Cloi adopts a **security-first approach**, ensuring user privacy, data integrity, and robust LLM interactions.

### Measures Implemented
1. **Data Sanitization**: Inputs are validated against JSON schemas using `ajv` to ensure security.
2. **Privacy Protections**:
   - Use of local models (Ollama) for environments requiring offline processing.
   - Cloud communication to Claude is secured via API keys with role-based permissions.
3. **Encryption**:
   - Communication with Claude API is encrypted over HTTPS.
4. **Plugin Sandbox**:
   - Plugins operate in a sandboxed environment to avoid unauthorized access to the core system.
5. **Role-Based Security**:
   - Developers must authenticate through pre-defined roles to invoke operations that modify sensitive code or configuration.

### Vulnerability Mitigation
- Regular audits of dependencies using tools like `node-cron` for updates.
- Input and query rate-limiting.

## Extension Points

### Extensibility Philosophy
Cloi is designed with modularity and scalability in mind. Developers can extend the system by leveraging its **plugin architecture** or by defining new protocols.

### Extensible Components
1. **Plugins**
   - Plugins provide an easy way to add new capabilities.
   - Example Directories:
     - `src/plugins/quality/` for quality-related extensions.
     - `src/plugins/integrations/` for CI/CD or browser testing integration.
   - Development Steps:
     - Create a directory under `src/plugins/` (e.g., `my-plugin`).
     - Implement required methods in `index.js` (such as `analyze()` or `transform()`).
     - Register the plugin using the plugin manager.

2. **Protocols**
   - Developers can define new communication protocols (e.g., gRPC, WebSockets).
   - Example Directory: `src/protocols/a2a/`.
   - Steps:
     - Define protocol behavior in `setup-*.js`.
     - Use the `universal-client.js` to bind it to existing workflows.

3. **ML Model Integrations**
   - Developers can integrate proprietary or experimental ML models.
   - Steps:
     - Implement the wrapper for the model using a similar abstraction as `src/plugins/providers/claude/`.

4. **Analyzer Widgets**
   - Analyzer hooks allow tool-specific integrations like repository audits or documentation checks.
   - Implement custom analyzers under `src/plugins/analyzers/`.

## Conclusion
Cloi's architecture strikes a balance between a robust core and modular extensibility. It integrates state-of-the-art ML infrastructure and LLMs to deliver high-quality code fixes while maintaining a focus on user privacy and security.

Developers are encouraged to leverage the extension points outlined in this document to tailor Cloi to their unique workflows.
