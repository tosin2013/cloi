**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-XX  
**Authors:** Development Team  
**Reviewers:** Architecture Team, Error Analysis Specialists  
**Domain Impact:** Error Analysis Domain (Primary), AI/LLM Integration Domain (Secondary), CLI Domain (Secondary)

## Context and Problem Statement

The CLOI system requires a sophisticated error classification and analysis framework to accurately identify, categorize, and process different types of errors across multiple programming languages, frameworks, and development contexts. Without a coherent **Error Analysis Domain**, CLOI cannot provide targeted and effective debugging assistance, leading to generic solutions that may not address the root causes of specific error types.

### Domain-Driven Design Context

**Primary Bounded Context:** Error Analysis and Classification Domain  
**Secondary Contexts:** AI/LLM Integration (for analysis enhancement), CLI Domain (for error input/output)  
**Aggregate Root:** Error Classification Engine  
**Domain Language:** Error Types, Severity Levels, Context Extraction, Root Cause Analysis, Error Patterns, Diagnostic Classification  
**Domain Events:** Error Received, Error Classified, Context Extracted, Analysis Completed, Fix Strategy Recommended

### Problem Manifestation

1. **Lack of Systematic Error Classification:**
   ```javascript
   // Before: Generic error handling
   function analyzeError(errorMessage) {
     // All errors treated similarly
     // No domain-specific classification
     // Limited context awareness
     return genericAnalysis(errorMessage);
   }
   ```

2. **Missing Domain-Specific Intelligence:**
   - No distinction between syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors
   - Inability to recognize language-specific error patterns
   - No framework-aware error analysis (React, Vue, Express, etc.)
   - Missing severity assessment and priority classification

3. **Inadequate Context Extraction:**
   - Limited understanding of error environment and circumstances
   - No correlation between related errors
   - Missing dependency and configuration context
   - Insufficient code context around error locations

4. **Inconsistent Analysis Quality:**
   - Variable quality of error analysis across different error types
   - No standardized approach to error investigation
   - Missing systematic methodology for complex error scenarios
   - Lack of learning from previous error patterns

## Decision Drivers

### Domain Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Classification:** Must categorize errors by type, severity, language, framework, and context
2. **Context-Aware Analysis:** Must extract and utilize relevant contextual information for accurate diagnosis
3. **Extensible Framework:** Must support addition of new error types and analysis strategies
4. **Pattern Recognition:** Must identify recurring error patterns and common root causes

### Technical Constraints

1. **Performance Requirements:** Classification must complete within acceptable time limits (< 2 seconds)
2. **Language Support:** Must handle errors from multiple programming languages and frameworks
3. **Accuracy Requirements:** Must achieve high accuracy in error type identification (> 85%)
4. **Integration Requirements:** Must integrate with AI/LLM systems for enhanced analysis

### Quality Requirements

1. **Diagnostic Precision:** Must provide specific, actionable diagnostic information
2. **False Positive Management:** Must minimize incorrect classifications
3. **Confidence Scoring:** Must provide confidence levels for classifications
4. **Continuous Learning:** Must improve classification accuracy over time

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Rule-Based Classification System
**Domain Impact:** Deterministic but limited scalability and adaptability
**Pros:**
- Predictable and explainable results

**Pros:**
- Can learn from examples and adapt to new patterns
- Potentially high accuracy with sufficient training data
- Can handle complex error scenarios
**Cons:**
- Requires large training datasets
- Less explainable results
- May struggle with edge cases
- High computational requirements

### Option 3: Hybrid Classification with Domain-Driven Architecture (CHOSEN)
**Domain Impact:** Creates robust Error Analysis domain with both deterministic and adaptive capabilities
**Pros:**
- Combines rule-based precision with ML adaptability
- Domain-specific classifiers for different error categories
- Explainable results with confidence scoring
- Extensible architecture for new error types
- Clear separation of concerns within the domain
**Cons:**
- More complex implementation
- Requires both rule maintenance and ML model management
- Need for comprehensive testing strategy

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Solution

Implement a **Hybrid Error Classification Architecture** with domain-driven design principles, combining rule-based classification for well-known patterns with AI-enhanced analysis for complex scenarios.

```javascript
// Error Analysis Domain Architecture
class ErrorClassificationEngine {
  constructor() {
    this.classifierRegistry = new ClassifierRegistry();
    this.contextExtractor = new ErrorContextExtractor();
    this.patternMatcher = new ErrorPatternMatcher();
    this.severityAssessor = new SeverityAssessor();
    this.confidenceCalculator = new ConfidenceCalculator();
  }

  async classifyError(errorInput) {
    // 1. Extract comprehensive error context
    const context = await this.contextExtractor.extract(errorInput);
    
    // 2. Identify primary error characteristics
    const primaryClassification = await this.performPrimaryClassification(context);
    
    // 3. Apply domain-specific analysis
    const domainAnalysis = await this.performDomainSpecificAnalysis(
      primaryClassification, 
      context
    );
    
    // 4. Assess severity and priority
    const severity = await this.severityAssessor.assess(
      primaryClassification, 
      context
    );
    
    // 5. Calculate confidence scores
    const confidence = this.confidenceCalculator.calculate(
      primaryClassification, 
      domainAnalysis
    );
    
    return new ErrorClassification({
      primaryType: primaryClassification.type,
      subType: primaryClassification.subType,
      severity: severity,
      confidence: confidence,
      context: context,
      domainAnalysis: domainAnalysis,
      recommendedStrategies: this.getRecommendedStrategies(primaryClassification)
    });
  }

  async performPrimaryClassification(context) {
    const classifiers = [
      new SyntaxErrorClassifier(),
      new RuntimeErrorClassifier(),
      new LogicalErrorClassifier(),
      new EnvironmentErrorClassifier(),
      new DependencyErrorClassifier()
    ];

    const results = await Promise.all(
      classifiers.map(classifier => classifier.classify(context))
    );

    return this.selectBestClassification(results);
  }
}

// Domain-Specific Error Types
class ErrorType {
  static SYNTAX = new ErrorType('SYNTAX', 'Syntax and parsing errors');
  static RUNTIME = new ErrorType('RUNTIME', 'Runtime execution errors');
  static LOGICAL = new ErrorType('LOGICAL', 'Logic and algorithm errors');
  static ENVIRONMENT = new ErrorType('ENVIRONMENT', 'Environment and configuration errors');
  static DEPENDENCY = new ErrorType('DEPENDENCY', 'Dependency and package errors');
  static NETWORK = new ErrorType('NETWORK', 'Network and connectivity errors');
  static SECURITY = new ErrorType('SECURITY', 'Security and authentication errors');
  static PERFORMANCE = new ErrorType('PERFORMANCE', 'Performance and resource errors');
}

// Severity Assessment Framework
class SeverityLevel {
  static CRITICAL = new SeverityLevel('CRITICAL', 1, 'System unusable');
  static HIGH = new SeverityLevel('HIGH', 2, 'Major functionality affected');
  static MEDIUM = new SeverityLevel('MEDIUM', 3, 'Some functionality affected');
  static LOW = new SeverityLevel('LOW', 4, 'Minor issues');
  static INFO = new SeverityLevel('INFO', 5, 'Informational');
}
```
