# ADR-014: Environment Context Detection Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-14  
**Deciders:** CLOI Development Team  
**Technical Story:** [Configuration Management Domain Enhancement - Environment Context Detection]

## Context and Problem Statement

The CLOI system requires sophisticated environment context detection to provide accurate, context-aware assistance. The system must intelligently detect development environments, runtime contexts, deployment configurations, and project characteristics to tailor responses appropriately. This capability must operate within the Configuration Management Domain while providing rich context data to other domains.

### Domain-Driven Design Context

**Bounded Context:** Configuration Management Domain  
**Aggregate Root:** Environment Context Detector  
**Domain Language:** Environment Variables, Runtime Context, Development Environment, Project Configuration, Deployment Context  
**Core Domain Events:** Environment Detected, Context Changed, Configuration Updated, Environment Validated

## Decision Drivers

### Domain-Driven Considerations
- **Aggregate Consistency:** Unified environment context representation across all system components
- **Ubiquitous Language:** Consistent terminology for environment and configuration concepts
- **Bounded Context Integrity:** Environment detection logic contained within configuration domain
- **Domain Service Reliability:** Accurate environment detection across diverse development setups

### Technical Requirements
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Detection across Windows, macOS, Linux development environments
- **Runtime Context Awareness:** Understanding of Node.js, Python, Java, and other runtime environments
- **Project Type Detection:** Identification of web apps, APIs, libraries, mobile apps, desktop applications
- **Configuration Discovery:** Automatic detection of configuration files and environment settings

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Static Configuration File Reading
- **Domain Impact:** Oversimplified aggregate with limited context awareness
- **Technical:** Basic reading of known configuration files without intelligent analysis
- **Pros:** Simple implementation, minimal resource usage
- **Cons:** Limited context understanding, poor adaptation to new environments

### Option 2: Intelligent Multi-Layer Context Detection ⭐ (Chosen)
- **Domain Impact:** Rich aggregate with comprehensive environment understanding
- **Technical:** Multi-layered detection combining file analysis, process inspection, and heuristics
- **Pros:** Comprehensive context, adaptive detection, accurate environment profiling
- **Cons:** Higher complexity, requires ongoing maintenance for new environments

### Option 3: External Environment Services
- **Domain Impact:** Violates bounded context with external dependencies
- **Technical:** Delegate environment detection to external services or tools
- **Pros:** Reduced implementation complexity, specialized expertise
- **Cons:** Domain boundary violation, dependency risk, potential privacy concerns

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Intelligent Multi-Layer Context Detection with Adaptive Learning

### Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Domain: Configuration Management
// Aggregate: Environment Context Detector
class EnvironmentContextDetector {
  constructor() {
    this.platformDetector = new PlatformDetector();
    this.runtimeAnalyzer = new RuntimeAnalyzer();
    this.projectClassifier = new ProjectClassifier();
    this.configurationAggregator = new ConfigurationAggregator();
  }

  async detectEnvironmentContext(workingDirectory = process.cwd()) {
    // Domain Event: Environment Detection Started
    const detectionTasks = await Promise.allSettled([
      this.detectSystemContext(),
      this.detectRuntimeContext(workingDirectory),
      this.detectProjectContext(workingDirectory),
      this.detectDeploymentContext(workingDirectory)
    ]);

    const contexts = this.processDetectionResults(detectionTasks);
    
    // Domain Event: Environment Context Aggregated
    const environmentContext = await this.configurationAggregator
      .synthesizeContext(contexts);

    // Domain Event: Environment Context Validated
    const validatedContext = await this.validateAndEnrichContext(environmentContext);

    return {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      workingDirectory,
      context: validatedContext,
      confidence: this.calculateContextConfidence(validatedContext),
      recommendations: await this.generateEnvironmentRecommendations(validatedContext)
    };
  }
}
```

   - Clean interfaces for Error Analysis Domain to understand environment factors
   - Efficient collaboration with Plugin Management for environment-specific plugins

4. **Adaptive Context Understanding**

   - Automatic adaptation to new development environments and tools
   - Comprehensive context enrichment with deployment and cloud platform detection

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Detection Foundation
```javascript
// Basic environment detection
class CoreEnvironmentDetection {
  async initializeDetection() {
    await this.setupSystemDetection();
    await this.initializeRuntimeDetectors();
    await this.loadProjectClassifiers();
  }

  async quickEnvironmentScan(workingDirectory) {
    const basicContext = {
      system: await this.detectBasicSystemInfo(),
      runtime: await this.detectPrimaryRuntime(workingDirectory),
      project: await this.detectProjectType(workingDirectory)
    };

    return this.generateQuickContext(basicContext);
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Context Analysis
```javascript
// Comprehensive environment profiling
class EnhancedEnvironmentAnalysis {
  async deepEnvironmentAnalysis(workingDirectory) {
    const comprehensiveContext = {
      system: await this.comprehensiveSystemAnalysis(),
      runtime: await this.multiRuntimeAnalysis(workingDirectory),
      project: await this.projectCharacteristicsAnalysis(workingDirectory),
      deployment: await this.deploymentEnvironmentAnalysis(workingDirectory),
      security: await this.securityContextAnalysis(workingDirectory)
    };

    return this.synthesizeComprehensiveContext(comprehensiveContext);
