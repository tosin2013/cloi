## Domain-Driven Design Guidelines

When creating new ADRs, apply these DDD principles:

### Bounded Context Analysis
- **Ubiquitous Language:** Define domain-specific terminology
- **Context Boundaries:** Identify clear domain separations
- **Domain Events:** Document triggered events and their propagation
- **Aggregate Design:** Define aggregate roots and consistency boundaries

### Domain Service Patterns
- **Service Interfaces:** Define how domains interact
- **Data Flow:** Document information flow between contexts
- **Integration Patterns:** Specify inter-domain communication
- **Error Propagation:** Define how errors cross domain boundaries

### Technical Alignment
- **Domain Language Compliance:** Ensure technical decisions align with domain vocabulary
- **Aggregate Consistency:** Maintain transactional boundaries within aggregates
- **Event Sourcing:** Consider event-driven patterns where appropriate
- **Repository Patterns:** Abstract data access within domain boundaries
