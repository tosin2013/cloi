# ADR-018: AI Response Quality Assessment

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-14  
**Deciders:** CLOI Development Team  
**Technical Story:** [AI/LLM Integration Domain Enhancement - Response Quality Assessment]

## Context and Problem Statement

The CLOI system relies heavily on AI-generated responses for error analysis, code suggestions, and user assistance. Ensuring the quality, accuracy, and reliability of these AI responses is critical for maintaining user trust and system effectiveness. The system must implement comprehensive quality assessment mechanisms that operate within the AI/LLM Integration Domain while providing feedback to improve response quality over time.

### Domain-Driven Design Context

**Bounded Context:** AI/LLM Integration Domain  
**Aggregate Root:** AI Response Quality Assessor  
**Domain Language:** Response Quality, Confidence Scoring, Accuracy Assessment, Relevance Analysis, Safety Validation  
**Core Domain Events:** Response Generated, Quality Assessed, Feedback Collected, Model Updated, Quality Threshold Exceeded

## Decision Drivers

### Domain-Driven Considerations
- **Aggregate Consistency:** Unified quality assessment across all AI response types
- **Ubiquitous Language:** Consistent terminology for quality concepts and assessment criteria
- **Bounded Context Integrity:** Quality assessment logic contained within AI/LLM integration domain
- **Domain Service Reliability:** Consistent and accurate quality evaluation across different AI models

### Technical Requirements
- **Multi-Dimensional Assessment:** Quality evaluation across accuracy, relevance, safety, and usefulness dimensions
- **Real-Time Evaluation:** Fast quality assessment suitable for interactive user experiences
- **Continuous Learning:** Feedback-driven improvement of quality assessment algorithms
- **Model Agnostic:** Quality assessment independent of specific AI model implementations

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Simple Confidence Score Checking
- **Domain Impact:** Oversimplified aggregate with limited quality understanding
- **Technical:** Basic confidence score thresholding from AI model outputs
- **Pros:** Simple implementation, minimal computational overhead
- **Cons:** Poor quality assessment accuracy, no learning capability, limited dimensions

### Option 2: Multi-Dimensional Quality Assessment Engine ⭐ (Chosen)
- **Domain Impact:** Rich aggregate with comprehensive quality evaluation capabilities
- **Technical:** Sophisticated assessment combining multiple quality dimensions and feedback learning
- **Pros:** Accurate quality assessment, continuous improvement, comprehensive evaluation
- **Cons:** Higher complexity, requires quality training data and feedback mechanisms

### Option 3: External Quality Assessment Services
- **Domain Impact:** Violates bounded context with external quality dependencies
- **Technical:** Delegate quality assessment to external AI evaluation services
- **Pros:** Proven assessment capabilities, reduced implementation effort
- **Cons:** Domain boundary violation, latency overhead, dependency risks

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Multi-Dimensional Quality Assessment Engine with Continuous Learning

// Aggregate: AI Response Quality Assessor
class AIResponseQualityAssessor {
  constructor() {
    this.dimensionAnalyzer = new QualityDimensionAnalyzer();
    this.confidenceCalculator = new ConfidenceScoreCalculator();
    this.safetyValidator = new SafetyValidator();
    this.feedbackIntegrator = new FeedbackIntegrator();
  }

  async assessResponseQuality(aiResponse, requestContext, userContext) {
    // Domain Event: Quality Assessment Started
    const qualityAssessment = await this.performComprehensiveAssessment(
      aiResponse, requestContext, userContext
    );

    // Domain Event: Quality Dimensions Analyzed
    const dimensionScores = await this.dimensionAnalyzer
      .analyzeDimensions(aiResponse, requestContext);

    // Domain Event: Safety Validation Completed
    const safetyAssessment = await this.safetyValidator
      .validateSafety(aiResponse, requestContext);

    return {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      responseId: aiResponse.id,
      quality: {
        overall: this.calculateOverallQuality(dimensionScores, safetyAssessment),
        dimensions: dimensionScores,
        safety: safetyAssessment,
        passesThreshold: this.meetsQualityThreshold(dimensionScores)
      },
      recommendations: await this.generateQualityRecommendations(qualityAssessment)
    };
  }

    const basicMetrics = {
      confidence: this.extractModelConfidence(aiResponse),
      completeness: this.assessBasicCompleteness(aiResponse, requestContext),
      safety: await this.performBasicSafetyCheck(aiResponse)
    };

    return this.calculateBasicQualityScore(basicMetrics);
