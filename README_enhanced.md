## üí° What is Cloi? (Project Overview)

Cloi is a **local debugging companion for developers**, designed to accelerate issue resolution in your codebase. Operating securely on your machine, Cloi uses cutting-edge AI models to understand errors and generate actionable fixes ‚Äì all without compromising your privacy.

- **Why Cloi?**
    - Debugging can be tedious. Cloi empowers developers by offering **AI-guided insights** and suggestions while maintaining complete **privacy**. Whether you're navigating a cluttered codebase or wrangling elusive bugs, Cloi helps you streamline debugging with **context-aware analysis**.
    
- **Core Values:**
    1. **Local-first Privacy:** All operations are performed on your machine ‚Äì no code or data is ever uploaded to the cloud.
    2. **Ease of Use:** Zero configuration required. Cloi integrates seamlessly with your terminal.
    3. **Developer-Centric:** Built for developers who value **convenience, flexibility, and control**.

**Disclaimer:**  
Cloi is experimental software (beta). Bugs may exist, and fixes might require review. Please report issues and share feedback through GitHub ‚Äì we value your contributions to make Cloi even better!

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Local Execution:** Use **Ollama models** on your machine or opt for external LLMs like Anthropic's Claude (with API support).
- **RAG Debugging:** Cloi detects relevant files in your project using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to offer more accurate fixes.
- **Interactive Commands:** Customize, debug, and iterate directly in your terminal.
- **Secure by Design:** All operations, from code indexing to debugging suggestions, remain on your local machine.
- **Extensible:** Modular architecture allows contributors to adapt and expand functionalities.

## üì¶ Installation

### Requirements:
- **Hardware:**
    - Memory: 8GB RAM (minimum), 16GB+ recommended
    - Storage: 10GB free (especially if using large models such as `Phi-4`)
    - Processor: Optimized for Apple M2/M3 chips  
- **Software:**
    - OS: macOS (Big Sur 11.0+)
    - Runtime: Node.js 14+ and Python 3.6+
    - Shell: Zsh (primary), Fish/Bash (limited testing)

### Steps:
1. Install Cloi globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @cloi-ai/cloi
   ```
2. Ensure you have **Ollama** installed (Cloi will handle this automatically if missing).

3. Navigate to your project directory and invoke Cloi:
   ```bash
   cloi
   ```

Want to use Anthropic's LLMs instead of local Ollama models? Add your API key:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```
Then, restart your terminal.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Start Cloi:**  
   Inside a project directory, simply run:
   ```bash
   cloi
   ```

2. **Interactive Commands:**
   Use built-in commands in Cloi's interactive mode to debug or refine workflows:
   ```
   /debug    - Auto-fix errors using AI models (starts RAG automatically)
/index    - Re-index your codebase for accurate debugging
/model    - Switch AI models (e.g., Ollama's local models or Claude)
/logging  - Enable automatic terminal error logging
/help     - Show all available commands
   ```

3. **Common Debugging Workflow Example:**  
   - Encounter an error during development:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
     _(Error: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined)_  
   - Call Cloi for context-aware debugging:
     ```bash
     cloi
     ```
   - Let Cloi's `/debug` feature pinpoint the issue, suggest a fix, and review changes interactively.

4. **Customizing Models:**  
   Choose from pre-installed Ollama models or use external APIs like Anthropic‚Äôs Claude via the `/model` command.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Cloi is built on a modular architecture designed to optimize local debugging:

- **Core Components:**
  1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines CodeBERT embeddings with BM25 keyword search for relevant code suggestions.
  2. **AI Models:**
      - Local (Ollama) models like Phi-4 and Qwen3.
      - External models such as Anthropic's Claude (via API).
  3. **Interactive CLI:** Enables developers to debug, re-index codebases, and manage workflows directly in the terminal.
  4. **Error Logging Service:** (Optional) Automatically logs errors for offline analysis (`~/.cloi/terminal_output.log`).

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers passionate about AI and debugging tools! Here‚Äôs how you can get involved:

1. **Reporting Issues:**  
   Found a bug or have a feature request? Open an issue [here](https://github.com/Cloi/issues).

2. **Submitting Pull Requests:**  
   Fork this repository and submit a pull request. Please ensure adherence to the following:
   - **Scope:** Contributions should align with the project's goals of providing a secure, local-first debugging assistant.
   - **Documentation:** Include appropriate comments and README updates for your changes.
   - **Testing:** Provide a clear description of how your feature or fix can be tested.

## üîß Troubleshooting

1. **Command Not Found:**
   - Ensure `@cloi-ai/cloi` is properly installed globally using `npm install -g`.
   - Check if your `PATH` is correctly set to include global npm packages.

2. **Missing Dependencies:**
   - Cloi will auto-install most dependencies upon first use. If errors persist, verify:
     ```bash
     node --version
     python3 --version
     ```
     Ensure required versions are installed.

3. **Zsh-Specific Features Not Working:**
   - Cloi's `/logging` relies on `.zshrc`. Ensure Zsh is your active shell (`echo $SHELL`).

4. **Large Model Download Hanging:**
   - Ensure stable internet access for first-time downloads (e.g., CodeBERT, Phi-4 models).

5. **Anthropic Key Invalid:**
   - Double-check your API key setup for external Claude-based models:
     ```bash
     export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
     ```
