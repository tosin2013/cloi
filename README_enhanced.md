## üìñ Overview 

Cloi CLI is a **local, AI-powered debugging tool** that helps developers pinpoint and resolve issues faster directly in their terminal. Designed with **privacy** and **developer-first principles** in mind, Cloi never sends your code or data to third-party servers unless explicitly configured. 

Its superpower lies in its Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and context-aware troubleshooting. Cloi gathers all relevant code, analyzes errors, and suggests fixes you can review and apply with a single command.

üöÄ **Key Value Proposition**:
- **Privacy First:** Everything runs locally or on supported private models (e.g., Ollama).
- **Seamless Integration:** Drop it into your development workflow without disrupting your tools.
- **Control:** No blind trust. Review every change Cloi suggests before committing.
- **Free & Extensible:** Build on Cloi‚Äôs open-source foundation to meet your exact needs!

> **Note:** Cloi is currently in beta development. Expect some bugs and occasional rough edges, but your feedback can help refine it! üöß Submit issues through GitHub or contribute directly by creating pull requests.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

### Requirements:
Before getting started, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

#### Hardware:
- **Memory:** 8GB+ RAM (16GB recommended)
- **Storage:** 10GB free disk space (Phi-4 model: ~9.1GB)
- **Processor:** Optimal performance on Apple Silicon (M2/M3)

#### Software:
- **Operating System:** macOS (11.0+ Big Sur)
- **Runtime Environments:**
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6+
- **Shell:** Optimized for Zsh (limited testing on Fish/Bash)

---

### Installation:

Run the following command to install Cloi globally:

```bash
npm install -g @cloi-ai/cloi
```

### First-Time Setup:
- Navigate to your project directory.
- Run `cloi` whenever you encounter an error! Cloi will automatically index your code and prompt for assistance.

> **No API key required:** Cloi seamlessly integrates with **Ollama models** and uses on-device intelligence.

---

## üí° Usage 

After installation, Cloi integrates into your everyday debugging workflow. Use the following practical examples to get started:

### **Debugging an Error**
1. Navigate to the directory where the error occurred.
2. Run the Cloi CLI:
   ```bash
   cloi
   ```
3. Cloi automatically fetches error traces, analyzes relevant files, and provides patch suggestions:
   ```bash
   [Cloi Suggestions]
   - Found the root cause in `app.js` (Line 42). Likely issue: undefined variable `userID`.
   - Suggested fix: Initialize `userID` variable in the constructor.

   --- Diff Preview ---
    Line 42: const userID = this.getUserID();
   ---------------------
   ```
4. Choose to **apply**, **edit**, or **discard** the fix.

---

### **Interactive Commands**
Enter interactive mode for advanced operations:
```bash
cloi
```
Then run:
- `/debug` ‚Äì Automatically analyze and fix errors with context-aware RAG.
- `/index` ‚Äì Re-index your codebase for improved debugging.
- `/model` ‚Äì Change AI models (e.g., switch to Claude-4 or other Ollama models).
- `/logging` ‚Äì Set up terminal output logging for continuous error monitoring.
- `/help` ‚Äì View all available commands.

---

### **Switching to Claude-4 Models**
If you‚Äôd like to use Anthropic‚Äôs Claude models (Sonnet-4/Opus-4):
1. Add your Anthropic API key:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
2. Add this line to your `~/.zshrc` file for persistence and restart your terminal:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

Now choose Claude-4 models via the `/model` command!

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview (High-Level)

Cloi‚Äôs architecture is designed for simplicity and powerful debugging workflows:

1. **Input:** User invokes `cloi` or interactive commands.
2. **Error Analysis:** Built-in parsers (e.g., StackTrace.js) find errors in logs or terminal output.
3. **Context Retrieval:**
   - Implements RAG via **CodeBERT embeddings** + **BM25 keyword search**.
   - Efficiently locates code files relevant to debugging.
4. **AI Models:**
   - Local AI models (Ollama‚Äôs Phi-4, etc.).
   - Optional cloud-based models (Claude-4/Opus).
   - All suggestions are contextually relevant.
5. **Change Suggestion:**
   - Diff preview provided for the user to accept/review.

## üîß Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues users encounter and how to resolve them:

### "Command not found: cloi"
- Ensure you‚Äôve installed Cloi globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @cloi-ai/cloi
  ```
- Double-check your `$PATH` configuration.

---

### "Error: No AI models found"
- Install Ollama from https://ollama.com/.
- Ensure the required model (`Phi-4`) is downloaded and ready for use.

---

### "Cloi freezes when analyzing large projects"
- Cloi performs indexing on the first run. Wait patiently or exclude unnecessary directories:
  - Create a `.cloiignore` file in your project:
    ```
    node_modules
    dist
    ```
