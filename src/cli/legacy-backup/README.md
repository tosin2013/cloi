# Legacy CLI Backup

These files have been backed up as part of the CLI unification process.

The CLOI CLI has been unified into `src/cli/unified.js` which combines:
- Interactive terminal interface (from index.js)
- Modular command-line interface (from modular.js)
- All enhanced features and workflows

## Files in this backup:
- index.js
- modular.js

## Next Steps:
1. Test the unified CLI thoroughly
2. If everything works correctly, these backup files can be removed
3. The unified CLI provides all functionality from the original files
